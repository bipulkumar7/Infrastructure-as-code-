# Infrastructure-as-code-

**Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 
The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources.**

The Five Pillars consist of the following areas: 
1. Operational Excellence, 
2. Security, 
3. Reliability, 
4. Performance Efficiency, and 
5. Cost Optimization.

### Operational Excellence.
 **When thinking about operational excellence in the cloud, it is useful to think of it in terms of automation.**
 **We will focus on the following two concepts for operational excellence: **

1.    Infrastructure as Code
2.    Observability

** Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing your infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files. IaC is the foundation that allows for the automation of your infrastructure.

IaC on AWS has traditionally been implemented using the CloudFormation service. CloudFormation requires declaring your resources using JSON or YAML. If these configuration languages aren't your cup of tea, AWS also provides the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) which allows you to author CloudFormation templates using native programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java.**

** Observability is the process of measuring the internal state of your system. This is usually done to optimize it to some desired end state. **
** Implementing observability involves the following steps: **

1.    Collection
2.    Analytics
3.    Action
